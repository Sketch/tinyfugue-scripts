TinyFugue is a terminal-based MU client.
This repository has a number of scripts that improve it.

infinilog.tf - Automatically log everything and rollover logs daily.
repose.tf    - Easily re-pose lines from log files to continue roleplaying.

These scripts require other scripts to run.
Grep for "REQUIRE:" and download the files with curl/wget.

TinyFugue is a terminal-based MU client.
This repository has a number of scripts that improve it.
These scripts are all from https://github.com/Sketch/tinyfugue-scripts

Directory structure:
util/    General utilities for TinyFugue.
rp/      Scripts for roleplaying MUs.
mud/     Scripts for action MUs.
lib/     Useful scripts that don't provide usable functionality on their own.

util/cg.tf        - Quickly switch worlds by substring.
util/infinilog.tf - Automatically log everything and rollover logs daily.
util/rwhen.tf     - Find out the timestamp of the most recent matching line.
rp/repose.tf      - Easily re-pose lines from log files to continue roleplaying.

Required libraries (by Cheetah@M*U*S*H):
lib/vworld.tf     - An API for managing connectionless sockets. (Virtual worlds)
lib/assoc.tf      - Association of key/value pairs. (Associative array)
lib/squish.tf     - Compresses runs of a character into a single character.

I personally coded util/infinilog.tf and rp/repose.tf
All scripts are for TinyFugue 5, tested on no lower than version beta 8.
